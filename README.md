Ohio House Bill 182, introduced by John Becker (District 65), is
egregious, but at the same time is being widely misrepresented as
requiring doctors to attempt to re-implant ectopic pregnancies. The bill
does no such thing. The intent of the bill is to prohibit insurance
providers from paying for abortion services.

Text of and link to _current_ version of section 9.05 of Ohio Revised
Code, which would be updated by the proposed bill.

>  9.04 State funds for nontherapeutic abortion benefits.
>  
>  (A) As used in this section:
>  
>  (1) "Nontherapeutic abortion" means an abortion that is performed or
>  induced when the life of the mother would not be endangered if the
>  fetus were carried to term or when the pregnancy of the mother was
>  not the result of rape or incest reported to a law enforcement
>  agency.

As of this writing HB 413 is being considered by the Ohio legislature's
House Insurance (INS) committee.

All that said, there is _another_ bill, House Bill 413 sponsored by
Candice R. Keller (District 53) and Rong Hood (District 78), which
_does_ expose a doctor to criminal prosecution if they do not attempt to
re-implant an ectopic pregnancy . . . Good Grief.

The craziness in question occurs on page 184 of the bill:

>  Sec. 2904.35. A physician who does all of the following is not
>  subject to criminal prosecution, damages in any civil action, or
>  professional disciplinary action, for a violation of this chapter:

(Lines 5365-5368)

>  (C) Takes all possible steps to preserve the life of the unborn
>  child, while preserving the life of the woman. Such steps include, if
>  applicable, attempting to reimplant an ectopic pregnancy into the
>  woman's uterus.

(Lines 5375-5378)

As of this writing HB 413 is being considered by the Ohio legislature's
Criminal Justice (CRJ) committee.
